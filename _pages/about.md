I'm a PhD in spatial data science and an urban planner, studying cities with machine learning, spatial statistics, and complex networks techniques at the [KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/) in Pisa, Italy. Here I share my work, ideas, insights, replications of peer papers, as well as discussions about urban data science, smart cities, data-driven urban planning, operations research, urban economics, and how cities *actually* work.

Working with urban planning firms, municipalities, UNDP, GIZ, and the World Bank, I also consult urban development, master planning, (E-) mobility, and transportation projects worldwide.

You can find my CV [here](https://lexparsimon.github.io/pdfs/Gevorg_Yeghikyan_Resume.PDF). Do not hesitate to contact me for questions, suggestions, and collaborations.
