## How do cities grow? 

Whether large cities are just scaled-up versions of small cities is still an [open question](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/10/2317). An important one for that matter.
In order to plan better cities, we need an improved understanding of how geography, urban economy, social and physical networks and political institutions come together to bring about growth or decline of cities. To achieve this, a thorough outlook on how urban settlements evolved over time is required. [Substantial research](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520081154/civilization-and-capitalism-15th-18th-century-vol-ii) claims that the social, economic, political, and organizational structures and their innovations that would triumph in "modernity," "capitalism," and the Industrial Revolution are rooted in and developed from medieval European settlements. 
On the other hand, medieval cities were qualitatively different: much smaller, agrarian, with a lower productivity, simpler technologies, and no organized market economy. Strictly hierarchical institutions as the feudal government, Church, and guilds exerted [a much stronger influence](https://uncpress.org/book/9780807844984/wage-labor-and-guilds-in-medieval-europe/) on the organization of social and economic life in medieval cities compared to analogous structures in modern cities. This influence manifested itself in segregated, corporate societies in which social groupings limited social and economic interactions and opportunities for individuals and families. The modern Western "free flow" of ideas, people, and goods was alien to medieval cities.

**These two different and at first sight conflicting perspectives raise the empirical question: Were medieval cities fundamentally different from modern cities? Or is there a continuum of urban processes, form and function from medieval to modern cities?**

Far from being just an interesting question, asking such questions is important for building a broad, historically-informed theory of urbanization. In this post, we will narrow down the raised questions and will try to **find out whether hierarchical institutions such as the Church or guilds limited and constrained social mixing and interaction in cities affecting urban economic and spatial growth**.
We will look at a dataset of built-up area and resident populations of 173 medieval cities at circa. 1300 AD, uncover their relationship with simple statistical techniques, and interpret the results in relation to two models from [settlement scaling theory](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162678#:~:text=Despite%20their%20many%20structural%20differences,within%20a%20given%20urban%20system.). 
The [first model](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6139/1438/tab-pdf), originally developed for describing modern cities, constructs the built-up area of cities as a function of their population size, considering the city as an unconstrained non-hierarchical socio-economic network embedded in space. The [second model](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162678#:~:text=Despite%20their%20many%20structural%20differences,within%20a%20given%20urban%20system.) builds on top of the first model by adding restrictions to social and economic interactions due to the impact of medieval institutions on social networking. This latter model predicts that, if this restrictive impact is strong, cities will have weak agglomeration effects, which would be visible in the relationship between built-up area and population.

## Modelling the spatial and social organisation in cities
On the one hand, one can imagine a medieval city as a self-organized, non-hierarchical social and spatial network entity. If so, interactions among people are only limited by transaction, transportation, [opportunity costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost), and the so-called "[matching costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_theory_(economics))" of between the needs, skills, and resources  of individuals. In such a network, interactions between any two persons are not restricted and occur freely. We will call this view of cities the *social reactor model*.
However, as already mentioned, such hierarchically organized medieval institutions as the Church, feudal authorities, guilds, family ties, etc., exerted huge power and control in medieval cities. This forms the basis for the hypothesis that these institutions strongly regulated the contacts between people in different social groups, hence restricting the social interactions that boost economic
productivity, flows of ideas, and the creation of knowledge and innovation. We shall call this view of cities the *structured social interaction model* and discuss the corresponding mathematical model based on hierarchical graphs capturing the mentioned social and economic regulation. We will then statistically analyse the available data and test our hypothesis by interpreting the results of the data analysis from the perspective of these models.
