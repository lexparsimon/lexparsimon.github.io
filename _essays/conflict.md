excerpt: 'Will AI and automation bring about a new social conflict?'
mathjax: 'true'
---

In his classic work, the Production of Space, Henri Lefebvre argued that “new social relationships call for a new space, and vice versa.”
With all the discussions on AI and automation gaining momentum, along with the growing anxiety associated with them, the future of 
production relations, power structures, and social relationships becomes increasingly uncertain. Hand in hand, as urban theory suggests,
so does the future of cities. 
In order to reflect on the possible urban futures unleashed by the effects of AI and automation on the social organization of space, 
one should ask, following Lefebvre: is a new social conflict structurally possible? The answer to this question might contain the seeds 
for ideas about the future of work, social relations, forms of social organization, and, ultimately, cities.

So how should we approach this question? One need not be familiar with Marxist thought to know that capitalist production functions by
appropriating the surplus value created by (social) labour. However, what is interesting in terms of the possibility of a new social 
conflict due to AI and automation, is how capitalism does so. In Capital, Marx distinguishes between formal and real subsumption of 
labour by capital. Under formal subsumption, labour is exploited by capital simply in socio-economic terms. It occurs when the 
capitalist monopolises the means of production, and therefore, forces the worker to yield to the conditions of wage labour, become hired,
and give away their added value. Real subsumption, on the other hand, occurs along with the technological evolution of capitalist 
production, under which the worker is dominated by the capitalist not only because he is hired by the latter, but also because in the 
very process of production, the worker is exploited by the material movement of capital. He is dominated by the system of machines and 
becomes a kind of a living appendix to them, forced to work according to the technological logic of the machinery he operates, or rather,
is operated by. In other words, the worker is subsumed by capital not only in terms of production relations, but also in terms of the 
very production processes he works in. This, according to Marx, is what makes the domination of labour by capital in organisational and
administrative terms, and hence, the efficient obtaining of maximum surplus value from the employment of labour, possible. 
This theoretical framework can be easily extended to post-industrial economies dominated by services by replacing the machinery logic 
with, for instance, the bureaucratic-administrative logic of typical office work.

Now, what is it that changes in capitalist production with the advent and introduction of Industry 4.0 with Machine-to-Machine, 
Internet of Things, and AI systems? The worker as an appendix to the production process essentially disappears, and with it, disappears
also the bundle of manager and supervisor positions telling the worker what and how to do, since there is no one anymore to command over:
algorithms and robots are now at work. Unlike the disappearing factory or white collar workers, the remaining employees, required to 
develop, innovate, and sustain production, such as R&D scientists, engineers, and business developers, are not working under real 
subsumption by capital. They are mainly concerned with intellectual and creative work in which they are operationally free. Although the
external socio-economic conditions are still dictated by capital since these creative workers are being employed by it (formal 
subsumption), in the very creative process, however, they are not functionally dominated by capital. Moreover, with the capitalist 
losing leverage over traditional workers due to automation replacing them, the creative workers gain further space for operational 
freedom. Thus, the widespread introduction of Industry 4.0 and AI systems completely or partially abolishes real subsumption in 
capitalist production. 

Interestingly, this is precisely where space for a new social conflict structurally opens up. While the conflict between the traditional
industrial worker and the capitalist revolved around wages, working hours and conditions, the creative worker is typically well-paid, 
enjoys retirement benefits, vacations, and is often even lured by employee share option plans, offering company shares to its employees.
Therefore, the conflict is to be found in a different place.

To understand the possibilities of the creative class entering into conflict with existing capitalist structures, it is worthwhile to 
look back at a structurally similar socio-economic conflict in history: that between the bourgeoisie and feudal aristocracy in 17th 
century Western Europe. Comedies of that epoch outstandingly show what the emerging bourgeois was striving for. He was striving to make 
his way to the ruling classes through social climbing: marrying a noble woman or buying a noble title, thus turning from a bourgeois to 
a noble. For example, Moliere’s classic play Le bourgeois gentilhomme, an evident oxymoron, mocks such attempts of social climbing by 
the pretentious bourgeois and ingeniously shows the emerging class conflict.
Likewise, being only formally subsumed by capital and having considerable operational freedom, resources, and time at their disposal, 
many creative workers today dream about converting their creative abilities into capital and applying it with profit, thus liberating
themselves from the exploitation of capital and becoming capitalist entrepreneurs themselves. As we can see, this is structurally 
analogous to the 17-18th century bourgeoisie striving to liberate themselves from the domination of the monarchic system offering 
privileges to the aristocracy, by attempting social climbing to become aristocrats themselves. This state of affairs continued for 
almost two centuries, until the conflict between the ever-stronger bourgeoisie and the ever-weaker aristocracy first manifested itself 
in the former articulating their differences from the latter, and then burst into the bourgeois revolution.

Coming back to our days, with the ever-growing creative class, capital still succeeds in keeping it in check by offering privileged 
working conditions and share option plans, but it will not be able to do so indefinitely. Take the example of the so-called 
Scandinavian Nordic model. With an unparalleled level of social guarantees, education and healthcare in the developed part of the world,
it reached its limits already in the 80s when the portion of GDP redistributed through government spending, i.e., through a non-market 
mechanism, reached 65%. It was unable to go further, since doing so would mean to encroach the very heart of capitalist production 
destroying its main motivation: the appropriation of surplus value. Similarly, given the growth of the creative class, capital will not 
be able to attract and sustain all creative workers, and given the discussed aspirations of the latter, the conflict will thus only be 
exacerbated.

Now, whether the discussed conflict between the growing creative class and the current bourgeoisie will culminate in a revolution or 
will find another resolution is not only difficult to predict, but is secondary and irrelevant here. Of interest is how it can affect 
the social, political, and economic organization of urban space.

To understand the prospects of these pending socio-economic transformations shaping the urban landscape, let’s have a recourse to the 
already discussed historical period: before and during the French bourgeois revolution, as well as both its short and long term 
aftermath. Before and immediately after the revolution, in the late 18th century, the aristocracy, bourgeoisie, artisans, and workers 
had different urban mobility and use of urban space. Municipal power, exercised by the monarchy and the aristocracy tightly connected 
with it, built elaborate public spaces for displaying power as a performative ritual: processions of carriages pompously moved every day
along stylised boulevards connecting the various “hôtel particulier” to municipal or religious buildings situated in focal squares. 
Place des Vosges and Place de la Concorde in Paris are prime examples of such urban spaces. Thus, public space didn’t exist in the
modern sense and was merely serving as a stage for celebrating monarchic power. While lower class workers and artisans exercised minimal
mobility staying within the confines of their neighbourhoods and travelling almost exclusively by foot, the emerging bourgeoisie was 
increasingly mobile, agile, and seeking to establish its class identity. Class membership was first articulated through literacy, and a
new consumer culture such as the emergence of restaurants as a cheaper way to simulate a private cook that only nobles could enjoy.

And yet, segregation in cities was mainly vertical rather than horizontal, meaning that the poor lived on the higher floors of buildings
inhabited by the upper classes. One could often meet middle class members, artisanal masters, and lower class workers in the same 
neighbourhood. This was due to the initial alliance of reformist middle classes with the relatively well-doing artisanal classes. 

This began to change with the July revolution of 1830, when space started to play a central role in the creation of middle-class identity
following similar processes in London and Vienna. The noble landowners had overestimated the falling demand for noble mansion housing, 
incurring severe losses on investment, and eventually had to sell the land to private investors. The increasing migration to cities and 
the ensuing severe housing crisis, coupled with the socioeconomic transformations with the growing bourgeoisie and its quest for a new 
identity, compelled private developers to create and sell an image of a culturally homogeneous, technologically modern, and 
consumer-quality neighbourhoods in order to make money on new housing. Private capital thus subdivided previously aristocratic lands 
into smaller lots and made possible urban redevelopment in specific areas of the city, meeting the newly formed bourgeois consumer 
demand. These new quarters instigated the self-reinforcing horizontal stratification of the city, with rising property values attracting
financial and banking elites and the upper middle class, which further nourished consumer culture, already manifest in the design of new
housing blocks. To distinguish themselves both from the aristocracy and the lower classes, new kinds of public and private spaces were 
emerging. This included the appearance of boudoirs and, most notably, balconies, which, as argued by Francois Loyer, were aimed at 
displaying public wealth by “showing the world outside the location and size of an apartment’s salon.” The streets in these new quarters
were wider, straighter, and more luminous, containing more parks and public spaces. The socio-economic conditions thus shaped a different
kind of urban space, which made it possible to experience older areas of the city as such as well. As Victoria Thompson argued, the 
experience of wider streets made older streets seem even narrower, and this came to be associated with the poor, dark neighbourhoods. 
This only strengthened segregation in the city, and, given the low urban mobility of the lower classes and the poor living conditions in
such centrally located older parts of the city as Cite in Paris, planted the seeds for social tensions between the poor and the 
bourgeoisie for the first time. For example, as recounted by Eugene Roche, it was common belief among the poor in these quarters that 
the 1832 cholera was a plot of the rich (sounds familiar?), leading to disregard for social distancing and hygiene rules, and propelling
insurrection, resulting in a mortality rate in the poor quarters twice as high as the city average. 
Bourgeois urban redevelopment, the emergence of what we now call urban master planning, the Hausmann reconstruction, and rising rents 
eventually, towards the end of the 19th century, pushed the poor away from the city center to the city outskirts, where they lived in
poorly built, unsanitary housing and environment, from where they did not intrude the rich bourgeois quarters, concluding the horizontal
segregation process that had begun almost a century earlier.  

This rather lengthy historical excursion served to delineate the framework for a conceptually similar possible transformation of urban 
space following the emergence of the creative class and its conflict with the current bourgeois elites. The economic geography for one 
such transformation model has been described by the urbanist Dror Poleg in a recent article. Poleg starts by recounting the following 
idea of Chris Anderson: historically, the entertainment industry was built around producing and promoting “hits”, since there were 
economic and physical restrictions. The production, shipping, storing, and displaying CDs or books was expensive, there were not many 
cinemas, and there were only 24 hours in a day. This meant that producing a wide range of albums, books, or movies was not economically 
viable and hence the industry was dependent on hits following the Pareto rule: 20% of products made 80% of the sales.
The internet changed this by making the production, distribution and storage of, and access to content cheaper. Now, most of the sales 
are no longer coming from a few hits, but from what Anderson calls the “long tail” of highly customized products, of interest to a very 
narrow audience.

The sheer quantity of such “narrow” products creates near-unlimited choice and makes the bulk of most consumer demand.
Poleg calls this the economics of abundance and goes on to link this idea to urban geography. While economic scarcity historically produced spatially concentrated population and economic activity distributions in cities, the emergence of remote working options will cause population and economic activity to be distributed across a long tail of many city locations instead of a few spatially concentrated centers as before. He then notes that under economics of scarcity, the spatially concentrated urban locations are designed to appeal to the largest number of people since they share the same urban infrastructure, centrally located job market, and public spaces. However, under economics of abundance, people won’t have to share the same space. City locations could become as customized as the songs people choose to listen to, making cities even more segregated.

One key aspect our discussion about automation and AI is missing so far is that automation is not taking place uniformly across all levels of production. This consideration is based on Paul Krugman’s hot-dog economy toy model. In this model, the economy produces just hot-dogs, consisting of two goods, sausages and bread rolls. Let’s assume that advances in technology allow the bakeries to be automated, boosting productivity and dropping the cost per bread roll produced. This cost reduction causes a rise in demand for hot-dogs, other things being equal. But since automation took place only in bakeries, while sausages continue to be produced manually, this means that demand for manual labour in the sausage industry will have to rise to meet the growing hot-dog demand.
So far, the solution has been to tap into cheap labour in the third world. For example, a technological innovation in Silicon Valley increases productivity in the upper levels of production but simultaneously raises demand for additional manual labour in the lower levels of production. Consider that despite automation and AI, the global workforce has actually doubled in the past decades reaching 3.5 billion people - much faster than population growth. Incidentally, this might also be the reason why despite the technology being available for quite some time now, corporations have not been in a hurry to shift to automated production, preferring cheap manual labour somewhere in Southeast Asia instead. However, unless automation takes place uniformly across different levels of production chains, which it won't, we might actually face a workforce shortage, given the limited rural population and the current rates of urbanization. This means the possibility for a different kind of social conflict in that part of the world which is, however, out of the scope of this article.
 
In the developed world, given the growing ambitions and aspirations of creative workers, gradual and unequal automation can trigger new forms of social organisation of space following the logic discussed in the historical excursion as well as in the shift of urban activity to the “long tail”. Urban segregation on the “long tail”, for example, can take the form of a digital divide, but in reverse. With automation bringing low skilled labour wages below the level of subsistence, universal basic income (UBI) will most likely become an imperative policy to sustain the structurally unemployable segment of population, making it a class of its own. This UBI class will be offered basic services in their neighbourhoods and super cheap access to digital services, but will be denied a range of new kinds of physical services like novel infrastructures serving specific technologies in transport, logistical, and recreational activities, as well as quality healthcare and education in customized quarters of the creative classes. This might create a feedback loop of further investment in those areas, pushing the UBI class away, concluding the urban segregation process, just like the ascending bourgeois pushed low wage workers away to the city outskirts 150 years ago.
Moreover, a certain physical-digital consumer culture of minor luxuries will have to be facilitated to keep the UBI class entertained within the range of their basic income.
The closest analogy is the French general Gallieni who conquered Madagascar, imposed a head tax in the newly issued local currency in 1901, effectively printing money and demanding that everyone give some of that money back to him. Described in detail in David Graeber’s seminal work, this forced the creation of certain markets and population debt, but also aimed at nurturing a consumer culture of cheap luxuries like lipstick or parasol, and making sure locals have some of their money left to spend on these products. It was crucial that they develop new tastes, habits, and desires; that consumer demand previously alien to them became ingrained in local culture to keep Madagascar forever tied to France even after the conquerors had left. 
 
Conclusion 
 
In an attempt to sketch the baseline for how AI and automation could affect social and urban structures, we looked at some concepts from Marx’s political economy, saw to what kind of social conflict could emerge with the advent of automation, looked at 17-19th century France to discover
